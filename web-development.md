## Type of testing
### Unit testing(Cheap)
> Testing of individual methods/functions of classes, components or modules used in a software.

### Integration testing(Expensive)
> Verify that different modules or services used by your applicaiton work well together. Ex. Verifying that interaction with database/microservices are work as expected.

### Functional testing
> Verify the output of an action but doesn't check the system performance state.

### End-to-end tesing(Expensive)
> Replicate a user behavior in a completed applicaiton environment. It also verify that user flow is working as expected.

### Acceptance testing
> Verify if a system satisfies its business requirements. Application is required to be up and running. Replicating user behaviors, measuring performance of system and rejecting changes if certains goals are not met.

### Performance testing(Costly)
> Checks the behaviors of the system when it is under significant load. It is non-functional and takes up various form to understand the reliability, stability, and availability of the platform. Costly to implement but help to understand if new changes are going to degrade the system.

### Smoke testing
> Checking of basic functionaloty of the application. Meant to be quick to execute and check if the major features of the system are working as expected. Useful after a build or right after a deployment.
